generate_tscan_kmers.py takes miRNA family seed sequences as input, and shuffles them, providing a specified number of shuffled sequences per miRNA family. In the manuscript, 6 shuffled 7mers per true seed were used
count_targetscan70_cons_output takes the output of targetscan_70.pl (available from the TargetScan website) as input, and counts gene-miRNA interactions with target sites conserved between human and a specified species
